# Terminal
My terminal is a "quake" style terminal. You can display or hide the terminal using the _caps lock_ key.

## Mac
* Launch [iTerm2](README.md)
* Open Preferences
* Profiles (tab) -> Window -> Style: **Full-Width Top of Screen**
* Add Transparency
* Add Blur
* Keys (tab) -> Hotkey -> **Show/hide with system-wide hotkey**

Note: I prefer to toggle the terminal using the _caps lock_ key which isn't supported out of the box.
I use [Karabiner](README.md) to map the "caps_lock" key to "print_screen" and toggle the terminal using the "print_screen" key.
